                  Patterns
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This interactive map displays pedestrian-involved vehicle
                  crashes across the United States from 2016 to 2023, clustered
                  using behavioral, environmental, and roadway context to
                  highlight underlying crash patterns. Each point on the map
                  represents a single crash event and is color-coded according
                  to its assigned cluster. These clusters were derived from a
                  national dataset of over 66,000 crash records, enabling
                  insights into the conditions and environments under which
                  pedestrian crashes most frequently occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cluster colors represent the following contextual

                </h2>
                <p>
                  This cluster represents crashes that occurred near school
                  zones or involved child pedestrians. It includes incidents
                  related to school bus activity, children darting into the
                  roadway, and play-related behavior such as running or biking
                  near traffic. While these types of crashes make up a smaller
                  percentage of the total dataset, they carry significant safety
                  implications due to the vulnerability of young pedestrians and
                  the environments in which these incidents typically occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These crashes often happen during school arrival or dismissal
                  times, and may involve low-speed local roads that are heavily
                  trafficked during short time windows. Intervention strategies
                  here include improved signage, reduced speed limits in school
                  zones, crossing guards, and infrastructure improvements like
                  raised crosswalks and flashing beacons.

                  Cluster 1: Poor Visibility or Weather Conditions
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This cluster captures pedestrian crashes that occurred under
                  challenging visibility or adverse weather conditions. These
                  include incidents at dusk, dawn, or nighttime, as well as
                  during rain, fog, snow, or sleet. Such environments reduce
                  both pedestrian visibility and driver reaction time, often
                  resulting in higher crash risk and severity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of these crashes occur outside of well-lit areas or
                  during transitional lighting conditions when visibility drops
                  rapidly. Roadways may lack sufficient lighting, reflective
                  signage, or pedestrian-focused design features. Additionally,
                  wet or icy road surfaces further contribute to delayed
                  stopping distances and unpredictable vehicle behavior.

                  Cluster 2: Legal Pedestrian Areas
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This cluster includes crashes where pedestrians were using
                  designated pedestrian spaces such as crosswalks, sidewalks, or
                  paved shoulders. These are areas where pedestrian presence is
                  expected and legally protected, yet crashes still occurred â€”
                  highlighting gaps in driver awareness, enforcement, or
                  infrastructure design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of these incidents involve drivers failing to yield at
                  marked crossings, turning without checking for pedestrians, or
                  encroaching into pedestrian space. While these areas are meant
                  to offer safety, lack of visibility, insufficient signage, or
                  driver distraction can undermine their effectiveness. This
                  cluster emphasizes the importance of not only building
                  pedestrian infrastructure but also ensuring it's respected and
                  reinforced through design and policy.

                <p>
                  This cluster represents crashes that occurred on high-speed
                  roadways such as interstates, freeways, and major arterial
                  routes. These environments are typically not designed with
                  pedestrian safety in mind and often lack sidewalks, safe
                  crossing points, or proper pedestrian visibility measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Crashes in this cluster tend to be more severe due to the
                  higher speeds involved. In many cases, pedestrians may have
                  been crossing mid-block, accessing transit stops, or walking
                  along shoulders or ramps. Some incidents may also involve
                  stranded pedestrians, vehicle breakdowns, or individuals
                  attempting to cross multiple lanes of fast-moving traffic.

                  This cluster captures crashes that occurred in rural or
                  low-inventory roadway environments. These areas often lack
                  basic pedestrian infrastructure such as sidewalks, crosswalks,
                  or adequate lighting. Long stretches of road, high vehicle
                  speeds, and limited enforcement contribute to elevated risk
                  for pedestrians.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pedestrians in rural areas may walk along unpaved shoulders,
                  cross highways with no marked crossings, or be involved in
                  vehicle breakdown situations. Crashes in this cluster can also
                  reflect agricultural, recreational, or work-related pedestrian
                  movement outside urban centers â€” contexts that require
                  different safety strategies than typical city environments.

                  Incidents in this group may include crashes in parking lots,
                  driveways, or non-trafficway locations; crashes involving
                  unique pedestrian behavior; or cases where critical details
